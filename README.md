**Write-Up: FOX-FOSTER Cryptography CTF Challenge**

Welcome to the FOX-FOSTER Cryptography CTF challenge! This exciting room invites participants to dive into the world of encryption and decryption. Throughout this challenge, participants encountered a variety of encrypted messages and employed different techniques to uncover their hidden meanings. Let's explore each question and its solution:

**Question 1: Decrypt the Message (Caesar Cipher)**
In the first challenge, participants were presented with the encrypted message "Hyhub lv d wuxh pbvwhub." The hint, "A simple shift is involved," directed participants to employ a Caesar cipher decryption. By applying a straightforward shift, participants unveiled the original message: "Every is a true mystery."

**Question 2: Decrypting with a Shift (Caesar Cipher)**
The second challenge mirrored the first, with the same encrypted message and a hint indicating a simple shift. Participants successfully applied the Caesar cipher decryption once again to reveal the message: "Every is a true mystery."

**Question 3: Keyword Decryption**
Moving forward, participants encountered a new challenge involving a keyword. With the keyword 'KEYWORD,' participants decrypted the message "EUHXKDQLVKRZIT" to uncover the original message: "UNIVERSITYCTF." The hint guided participants to consider using a keyword and replacing uncommon letters.

**Question 4: Binary Decoding and Transposition**
As the challenges progressed, participants faced a binary sequence "01000101 01001111 01010010 01001000 01001100 01001111 01000100 01001100 01010111 01001100." Decoding the binary into text, participants obtained "EORHLODLWL." A transposition step, as indicated by the hint, rearranged the characters to reveal the final message: "Hello World."

**Question 5: Decoding Morse Code with a Twist**
The final challenge introduced a Morse code message "--- -... -.-- -.-- ..-. / -... .-- / -.-. .--. --.. .--. .- / -- ...- . -- ...- --.. .- .-.. -.-- .-.-.- .--- ...- -." Participants first converted the Morse code to text: "OBYYF BW CPZPA MVEMVZALY.JVT." A unique twist, involving a small shift and a blend of techniques, led to the ultimate decryption: "HURRY UP VISIT FOXFOSTER.COM."

Congratulations to all participants who engaged in this captivating journey through cryptographic challenges. Each question showcased different techniques, encouraging participants to think creatively and utilize various methods to decipher encrypted messages. This CTF challenge emphasized the significance of cryptography and the thrill of unraveling secrets concealed within codes.

A big thank you to everyone who participated, and we hope you enjoyed the FOX-FOSTER Cryptography CTF challenge!
